# VGLOVES
Tired of using the same old unintuitive controllers for VR games? Use this code to make your own controllers which can be worn on a glove and controlled like a real hand. <br />
Act as controllers for Unity Games. <br />
They are basically flex sensors sewed on a glove controlled by an arduino hooked onto a laptop.
# Made using UNITY 3
As a suggestion, please use the package 'Ardity' for Unity, as that has a much simpler GUI for Unity and solves a lot of issues of mine (latency mainly).
