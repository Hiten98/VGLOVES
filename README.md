# VGLOVES
Act as controllers for Unity.
They are basically flex sensors sewed on a glove controlled by an arduino hooked onto a laptop.
# Made using UNITY 3
As a suggestion, please use the package 'Ardity' for Unity, as that has a much simpler GUI for Unity and solves a lot of issues of mine (latency mainly).
